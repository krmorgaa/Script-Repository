# Batch ID to Rodeo Button

This enhancement adds a “Rodeo Link” button directly next to each Batch ID in the Picking Console. With one click, it takes you straight to the correct Rodeo page without manually copying or retyping the ID. It saves time across dozens of batches and reduces error when navigating between systems, especially useful for fast-paced environments or troubleshooting teams.

# Fans YOW1 Autofill

This script enhances your workflow by allowing you to quickly and accurately fill in the "To:" field with the correct usernames of your team members using a smart dropdown menu.

With a single click, the correct username is inserted and ready to send, eliminating guesswork, typos, and the need to remember or look up login names. It streamlines communication, reduces errors, and saves valuable time during fast-paced operations.

# FC Research Top 5

This script enhances your search page with a toggleable widget that tracks the barcodes you search most often. It automatically ranks them into a dynamic top-5 list so you can reaccess high-priority barcodes with a single click. You can also clear the list, delete individual entries, or export your data to CSV for future reference — making it ideal for roles where frequent rechecks are common, such as problem solving or quality assurance.

# Items Not Assigned

This script provides a powerful real-time overview of work progress by summarizing key unit states—such as “Scheduler Assigned,” “Hotpick,” and “Refused”—directly within the Rodeo interface. With a simple toggle button, users can instantly view a floating widget that not only counts how many items fall into each of these categories, but also highlights the exact locations of any items that are not currently staged in scanners, making it easy to spot action-required inventory. The summary auto-refreshes every 10 seconds, ensuring the information stays current without manual input, and remains easy to read and scroll through even as the list grows—helping the user make quicker, more informed decisions during high-volume operations.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Fans Auto refresh, Time Zone change, and Message read tracker

This tool adds an intuitive "Auto Refresh" button to the Fans messaging dashboard, letting you automatically reload the page every five minutes. It includes a color-coded on/off toggle and a progress bar that fills as the next refresh approaches. Once enabled, it stays active across refreshes until turned off manually, so you’ll always have the latest messages without babysitting the page — perfect for associates managing high-volume workflows or urgent comms.

# FC Eligibility Forget-Me-Not

This tool makes managing associate assignments fast, organized, and stress-free by letting you create and maintain dropdown lists of names sorted by process path — VNA, Singles, BOD, Multi, and HOV. Instead of trying to remember who requested what, you can simply add names under the correct category, and with one click, assign them directly into the system. Names automatically disappear after being submitted, keeping your lists clean and up to date. If priorities shift, you can quickly clear everything with a single button, making reassignment easy. Whether you're stepping away for a break or logging off for the day, your assignments stay saved and ready, so you never lose track of your picks.

# Batch ID Copy Button

This script adds a small, convenient :clipboard: copy button directly beside/under each Pick Batch ID in Rodeo, allowing users to instantly copy the ID to their clipboard with a single click. Instead of manually highlighting and copying the number, the process becomes quick, accurate, and hassle‑free, reducing the risk of mistakes and speeding up workflows when Batch IDs need to be pasted into search tools, messages, or reports.

I have created 2 versions based on preference as they both alter the table slightly.

# PPR Hours tracker

This script adds a quick‑access floating widget that shows total Pick Support, Pack Support and VRETs hours at a glance.
 With one click, management can instantly see real‑time support hour totals without scanning through the full Process Path Rollup report. This can also be easily adjusted to incorporate other buckets.
