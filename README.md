With a single click, the correct username is inserted and ready to send, eliminating guesswork, typos, and the need to remember or look up login names.

# FC Research Top 5

This script enhances your search page with a toggleable widget that tracks the barcodes you search most often. It automatically ranks them into a dynamic top-5 list so you can reaccess high-priority barcodes with a single click. You can also clear the list, delete individual entries, or export your data to CSV for future reference — making it ideal for roles where frequent rechecks are common, such as problem solving or quality assurance.

# Items Not Assigned

This script provides a powerful real-time overview of work progress by summarizing key unit states—such as “Scheduler Assigned,” “Hotpick,” and “Refused”—directly within the Rodeo interface. With a simple toggle button, users can instantly view a floating widget that not only counts how many items fall into each of these categories, but also highlights the exact locations of any items that are not currently staged in scanners, making it easy to spot action-required inventory. The summary auto-refreshes every 10 seconds, ensuring the information stays current without manual input, and remains easy to read and scroll through even as the list grows—helping the user make quicker, more informed decisions during high-volume operations.

# Fans Auto refresh, Time Zone change, and Message read tracker

This tool adds an intuitive "Auto Refresh" button to the Fans messaging dashboard, letting you automatically reload the page every five minutes. It includes a color-coded on/off toggle and a progress bar that fills as the next refresh approaches. Once enabled, it stays active across refreshes until turned off manually, so you’ll always have the latest messages without babysitting the page — perfect for associates managing high-volume workflows or urgent comms.

# FC Eligibility Forget-Me-Not

This tool makes managing associate assignments fast, organized, and stress-free by letting you create and maintain dropdown lists of names sorted by process path — VNA, Singles, BOD, Multi, and HOV. Instead of trying to remember who requested what, you can simply add names under the correct category, and with one click, assign them directly into the system. Names automatically disappear after being submitted, keeping your lists clean and up to date. If priorities shift, you can quickly clear everything with a single button, making reassignment easy. Whether you're stepping away for a break or logging off for the day, your assignments stay saved and ready, so you never lose track of your picks.

# Batch ID Copy Button

This script adds a small, convenient :clipboard: copy button directly beside/under each Pick Batch ID in Rodeo, allowing users to instantly copy the ID to their clipboard with a single click. Instead of manually highlighting and copying the number, the process becomes quick, accurate, and hassle‑free, reducing the risk of mistakes and speeding up workflows when Batch IDs need to be pasted into search tools, messages, or reports.

I have created 2 versions based on preference as they both alter the table slightly.

# PPR Hours tracker

This script adds a quick‑access floating widget that shows total Pick Support, Pack Support and VRETs hours at a glance.

# Eligibility to Fans Messenger

This tool adds a small :envelope_with_arrow: icon next to each picker’s name on the eligibility page, allowing you to instantly send them a custom FANS message without ever opening or interacting with the FANS interface. Simply click the icon, type your message in the prompt, and it’s sent directly through Amazon’s internal FANS system using the same backend process as your existing messaging tools. This streamlines communication by removing extra steps, saves time when reaching multiple pickers, and ensures your messages are delivered quickly and reliably without navigating away from your current workflow.

# Rodeo Multi-Login CPT Filter

Just type in one or more logins, separated by commas, and the table instantly updates to show only relevant rows. This helps streamline investigations, monitor assignments, and reduce time spent scrolling through large data sets.

# FCLM Time Management Tracker

This Time Move Tracker adds a simple floating widget to the Amazon FCLM Time Details page, letting you quickly log minutes moved for each employee without losing track between sessions. It automatically pulls the employee’s login from the page, allows you to choose the destination process (Pick Support or VRETs), and keeps running totals for the current session and the entire shift. You can undo the last entry, reset sessions or shift totals, and export a neatly formatted CSV (with timestamps, process, minutes, and notes) for record-keeping or reporting.

Please note: At this time, this only has Pick Support and VRETs, but upon request I can add any other process.

# FANS Message Scheduler

This tool automatically sends pre-written FANS messages at your chosen time zone, letting you set up and manage multiple saved templates from a simple dropdown menu. Easily switch between different messages, edit details on the fly, and keep everything organized without having to retype or remember past messages. Designed for speed and consistency, it ensures your communications go out exactly as planned every day.

This can also be easily edited for any manager/shift easily within the widget itself.

# FCLM to Fans Messager

When you’re reviewing an associate’s Time on Task (TOT) in FCLM, this userscript adds a tiny :email: next to the Login. Click it to compose and send a FANS message instantly—using your already-open FANS tab—without copying the login or leaving the page. The message sends with one click and the box auto-closes on success, so you can keep moving through the TOT queue. Great for quick nudges, follow-ups, and coaching notes right as you spot them.

# Quick IPT Reference

This Tampermonkey add-on makes finding IPT numbers instant. Instead of hunting across a wide AWS-UI table, it auto-locates the “Shipments So Far” and “Today’s IPT Ship Plan” columns, pulls the values for the selected FC (e.g., YOW1), and surfaces them in a compact, always-on-top widget. The numbers are highlighted in the table for quick visual confirmation, auto-refresh as data updates, and can be copied with one click. Net result: consumers get today’s IPT picture in seconds—with less scrolling, fewer clicks, and fewer mistakes.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Atlas Defect Quick Widget

This widget scans the Totals Reports table and shows how much Damage, Short, Reject, Error Indicator, and Wrong ASIN contribute to overall defects. It uses Total → Defect Count (All) as the denominator and displays each type’s count and % of total in a compact panel. It updates automatically as you change site, dates, or filters, giving you a fast snapshot of where defect volume is concentrated for targeted coaching and follow-up.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Atlas DPMO Quick Widget

This companion widget reads the DPMO/Percentage column to compare defect types by rate, not just volume. Using Total (All) DPMO/Percentage as the baseline, it shows each type’s value and its share of the total rate, highlighting issues that are disproportionately risky even when counts are low. It stays in sync with any filter changes and sits just below the first widget, offering a clean, side-by-side view of volume vs. quality rate.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Rodeo CPT → FANS Messager

 Adds a tiny :email: next to each Login on the Rodeo CPT List. Click to send a quick FANS message (you can edit the prefilled text); Shift-click to send instantly. Uses your existing FANS tab (iad/pdx)—if none is open, just open FANS and click again. No extra widgets, no page changes, and everything runs locally in your browser.
