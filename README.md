# Batch ID to Rodeo Button

With one click, it takes you straight to the correct Rodeo page without manually copying or retyping the ID. It saves time across dozens of batches and reduces error when navigating between systems, especially useful for fast-paced environments or troubleshooting teams.

# Fans YOW1 Autofill

This script enhances your workflow by allowing you to quickly and accurately fill in the "To:" field with the correct usernames of your team members using a smart dropdown menu. As you begin typing any part of a name—first, last, or even a middle segment—it instantly suggests matching employees, clearly labeled with both their name and ID. With a single click, the correct username is inserted and ready to send, eliminating guesswork, typos, and the need to remember or look up login names. It streamlines communication, reduces errors, and saves valuable time during fast-paced operations.

# FC Research Top 5/10

This script enhances your search page with a toggleable widget that tracks the barcodes you search most often. It automatically ranks them into a dynamic top-5 list so you can reaccess high-priority barcodes with a single click. You can also clear the list, delete individual entries, or export your data to CSV for future reference — making it ideal for roles where frequent rechecks are common, such as problem solving or quality assurance.

# Items Not Assigned

This script provides a powerful real-time overview of work progress by summarizing key unit states—such as “Scheduler Assigned,” “Hotpick,” and “Refused”—directly within the Rodeo interface. With a simple toggle button, users can instantly view a floating widget that not only counts how many items fall into each of these categories, but also highlights the exact locations of any items that are not currently staged in scanners, making it easy to spot action-required inventory. The summary auto-refreshes every 10 seconds, ensuring the information stays current without manual input, and remains easy to read and scroll through even as the list grows—helping the user make quicker, more informed decisions during high-volume operations.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Fans Auto refresh, Time Zone change, and Message read tracker

This tool adds an intuitive "Auto Refresh" button to the Fans messaging dashboard, letting you automatically reload the page every five minutes. It includes a color-coded on/off toggle and a progress bar that fills as the next refresh approaches. Once enabled, it stays active across refreshes until turned off manually, so you’ll always have the latest messages without babysitting the page — perfect for associates managing high-volume workflows or urgent comms.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# FC Eligibility Forget-Me-Not

This tool makes managing associate assignments fast, organized, and stress-free by letting you create and maintain dropdown lists of names sorted by process path — VNA, Singles, BOD, Multi, and HOV. Instead of trying to remember who requested what, you can simply add names under the correct category, and with one click, assign them directly into the system. Names automatically disappear after being submitted, keeping your lists clean and up to date. If priorities shift, you can quickly clear everything with a single button, making reassignment easy. Whether you're stepping away for a break or logging off for the day, your assignments stay saved and ready, so you never lose track of your picks.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Batch ID Copy Button

This script adds a small, convenient :clipboard: copy button directly beside/under each Pick Batch ID in Rodeo, allowing users to instantly copy the ID to their clipboard with a single click. Instead of manually highlighting and copying the number, the process becomes quick, accurate, and hassle‑free, reducing the risk of mistakes and speeding up workflows when Batch IDs need to be pasted into search tools, messages, or reports.

I have created 2 versions based on preference as they both alter the table slightly.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# PPR Hours tracker

This script adds a quick‑access floating widget that shows total Pick Support, Pack Support and VRETs hours at a glance.
 With one click, management can instantly see real‑time support hour totals without scanning through the full Process Path Rollup report. This can also be easily adjusted to incorporate other buckets.

# Eligibility to Fans Messenger

This tool adds a small :envelope_with_arrow: icon next to each picker’s name on the eligibility page, allowing you to instantly send them a custom FANS message without ever opening or interacting with the FANS interface. Simply click the icon, type your message in the prompt, and it’s sent directly through Amazon’s internal FANS system using the same backend process as your existing messaging tools. This streamlines communication by removing extra steps, saves time when reaching multiple pickers, and ensures your messages are delivered quickly and reliably without navigating away from your current workflow.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Rodeo Multi-Login CPT Filter

This tool allows you to quickly search and filter the Rodeo table by one or more associate logins using a simple floating search box. Just type in one or more logins, separated by commas, and the table instantly updates to show only relevant rows. This helps streamline investigations, monitor assignments, and reduce time spent scrolling through large data sets.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# FCLM Time Management Tracker

This Time Move Tracker adds a simple floating widget to the Amazon FCLM Time Details page, letting you quickly log minutes moved for each employee without losing track between sessions. It automatically pulls the employee’s login from the page, allows you to choose the destination process (Pick Support or VRETs), and keeps running totals for the current session and the entire shift. You can undo the last entry, reset sessions or shift totals, and export a neatly formatted CSV (with timestamps, process, minutes, and notes) for record-keeping or reporting.

Please note: At this time, this only has Pick Support and VRETs, but upon request I can add any other process.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Rates Checking Presets

This tool adds three convenient quick-access buttons to the Function Rollup page, letting you instantly jump between Pick, Pack Singles, and Pack Multis reports without manually changing the process settings. With one click, you can switch views and get the exact data you need, saving time and streamlining your workflow.

Please note: At this time, this only has Pick Support and VRETs, but upon request I can add any other process.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# FANS Message Scheduler

This tool automatically sends pre-written FANS messages at your chosen time zone, letting you set up and manage multiple saved templates from a simple dropdown menu. Easily switch between different messages, edit details on the fly, and keep everything organized without having to retype or remember past messages. Designed for speed and consistency, it ensures your communications go out exactly as planned every day.

This can also be easily edited for any manager/shift easily within the widget itself.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# FCLM to Fans Messager

When you’re reviewing an associate’s Time on Task (TOT) in FCLM, this userscript adds a tiny :email: next to the Login. Click it to compose and send a FANS message instantly—using your already-open FANS tab—without copying the login or leaving the page. The message sends with one click and the box auto-closes on success, so you can keep moving through the TOT queue. Great for quick nudges, follow-ups, and coaching notes right as you spot them.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Quick IPT Reference

This Tampermonkey add-on makes finding IPT numbers instant. Instead of hunting across a wide AWS-UI table, it auto-locates the “Shipments So Far” and “Today’s IPT Ship Plan” columns, pulls the values for the selected FC (e.g., YOW1), and surfaces them in a compact, always-on-top widget. The numbers are highlighted in the table for quick visual confirmation, auto-refresh as data updates, and can be copied with one click. Net result: consumers get today’s IPT picture in seconds—with less scrolling, fewer clicks, and fewer mistakes.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Atlas Defect Quick Widget

This widget scans the Totals Reports table and shows how much Damage, Short, Reject, Error Indicator, and Wrong ASIN contribute to overall defects. It uses Total → Defect Count (All) as the denominator and displays each type’s count and % of total in a compact panel. It updates automatically as you change site, dates, or filters, giving you a fast snapshot of where defect volume is concentrated for targeted coaching and follow-up.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

https://axzile.corp.amazon.com/-/carthamus/script/atlas-defect-quick-widget

# Atlas DPMO Quick Widget

This companion widget reads the DPMO/Percentage column to compare defect types by rate, not just volume. Using Total (All) DPMO/Percentage as the baseline, it shows each type’s value and its share of the total rate, highlighting issues that are disproportionately risky even when counts are low. It stays in sync with any filter changes and sits just below the first widget, offering a clean, side-by-side view of volume vs. quality rate.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Rodeo CPT → FANS Messager

 Adds a tiny :email: next to each Login on the Rodeo CPT List. Click to send a quick FANS message (you can edit the prefilled text); Shift-click to send instantly. Uses your existing FANS tab (iad/pdx)—if none is open, just open FANS and click again. No extra widgets, no page changes, and everything runs locally in your browser.
 
If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# FCResearch Quick Search

This add-on speeds up FCResearch lookups. Just type three digits in the search bar (e.g., 123) and it automatically searches for tscage123. If you open a link like ...?s=123, it auto-corrects to ...?s=tscage123. Fewer keystrokes, fewer typos—nothing else on the page changes. Runs only in your browser; no data is sent anywhere.

# Rodeo Quick Search 

Type short codes and let the page fill the rest:
r### → relrg###
t### → tscage###
Works in the Search page and the ExSD top-right “Search Logins” box. The script expands your input before the search runs and also fixes URLs like ?searchKey=r123 → ?searchKey=relrg123. Faster searches, consistent formatting, zero extra clicks—everything stays local to your browser.

These are separate scripts but I made them as kind of a combo.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# HelpMeApp Global Alert

Never miss a help request. When a new request appears in the Pending Acknowledgement column, this browser add-on triggers a full-screen overlay on whatever tab you’re using with a clear message: ALERT; <reason>. Press Acknowledge on any tab and the popup closes everywhere at once. Optional sound + title flashing for extra visibility. Runs locally via a Tampermonkey userscript and only watches the HelpMe2 respond page.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This script still needs testing, but from what I can tell, it works fine.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Quick Inventory Reference

This script makes it easy to spot low inventory at a glance.
It highlights the Total WIP and Total Pickable numbers in the Rodeo ExSD banner when they drop below critical thresholds.
Values turn yellow as an early warning.
Values turn red when they fall into critical levels.
This ensures you don’t miss important volume changes, even when the page refreshes automatically. A small test panel is included so you can confirm the highlighting works; once verified, the panel can be removed for a clean display.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# FC Research ↔ QI Hover Bridge

Hover any container ID (format P-1-…) on the FC Research page to see a small, light-themed tooltip with Last counted, Counted qty, Counter, and Work type (stacked Label | Value). Behind the scenes, the script updates the QI Basic Bin History search to warehouse_id: YOW1 AND bin_id:P-1-<container> and scrapes the newest row—no clicks needed. Requirement: keep one QI tab open on Basic Bin History with this userscript enabled. If the tooltip shows blanks, re-authenticate the QI tab (“clear your session”) and it will resume automatically.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Rodeo Force Show Quantity

Some of the newer NewRodeo scripts automatically hide or collapse less-used columns in tables — including the Quantity column. While this can help declutter the view, it makes it harder to quickly reference item counts when you actually need them.
This script fixes that by forcing the Quantity column to always stay visible on the ItemList page. It doesn’t interfere with your other scripts, and only targets the Quantity/Qty column, so you can keep the benefits of the NewRodeo layout without losing access to this critical information.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Pick PA/FPY Unwind Autofill

This script helps Pick Process Assistants (PAs) and First Pass Yield (FPY) owners by automatically filling in the “Reason for Unwind” and selecting “Pick Batch ID” when submitting unwind requests. By removing repetitive clicks and typing, it speeds up the process, reduces error risk, and ensures consistency across all entries — letting Pick PAs and FPY focus on quickly resolving issues instead of wrestling with form inputs.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.

# Rodeo Scrollbar Adjustment

This tweak fixes the annoying 'scrollbar over the links' problem on Rodeo tables. It moves the horizontal scrollbar to its own rail just under the table so it never sits on top of the last row. You can still scroll side-to-side, but the bottom links remain fully clickable—no more fighting the bar. Vertical scrolling and the table’s behavior stay exactly the same.

If you have any questions or concerns about the use of this script, please reach out to krmorgaa on slack. Thank you.
